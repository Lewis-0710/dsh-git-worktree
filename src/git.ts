/**
 * Lightweight git belonging probe for ONE workspace directory: the three
 * facts the sidebar grouping needs and nothing else (no branch list, no
 * worktree list — {@link probeRepo} stays the full-facts path for the chip).
 *
 * All three facts come from ONE `git rev-parse` invocation: the sidebar
 * probes every registered workspace on each mount, and on Windows every git
 * call is a process spawn, so three sequential spawns per directory made the
 * startup probe cost scale with the workspace count directly. `rev-parse`
 * evaluates each flag in turn and prints one line per answer, so
 * `--show-toplevel`, `--git-common-dir`, and `--abbrev-ref HEAD` fold into a
 * single process.
 *
 * `repoRoot` — the grouping key — is derived from `--git-common-dir`, which
 * names the SHARED `<repo>/.git` from every worktree of the repository: the
 * main checkout reports it directly, a linked worktree reports the path back
 * to it. Both therefore resolve to the same repository root and group
 * together, wherever the linked folder physically lives.
 * `main` is decided without `worktree list`: a directory is the main worktree
 * exactly when its own toplevel holds that shared .git.
 * `branch` uses `--abbrev-ref HEAD`, whose detached/unborn output is git's
 * synthetic `HEAD` — normalized to null HERE so no consumer downstream ever
 * string-compares against it (the same contract the old `branch
 * --show-current` empty output mapped to).
 * @param exec - executor seam.
 * @param path - absolute directory the workspace reports.
 * @returns the facts, or undefined outside any git repository (a missing git
 * binary surfaces the same way — a non-zero exit through the seam).
