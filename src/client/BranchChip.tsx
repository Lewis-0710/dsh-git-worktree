/**
 * BranchChipDock: the composer tool-row entry (conversation.input.left, right
 * of the mode chips) for sessions inside a git repository. Blank sessions
 * OF THE MAIN checkout get the full segmented control — branch picker plus
 * the worktree isolation toggle — because that is the moment to choose the
 * environment for the conversation, and starting a worktree is a main-repo
 * decision. Once the session starts, the worktree toggle is withdrawn (its
 * directory is fixed). A session inside a LINKED worktree scopes the entry
 * down to TWO things, blank or started alike: the branch this worktree
 * holds (the position marker, trailing check included) and the 「工作树」
 * group of every OTHER worktree — the main checkout included, since from
 * in here that is another place to go — whose rows carry the hop. The
 * directory's identity IS its branch, so every other BRANCH would be a row
 * the owner must refuse — a menu of refusals is not a menu (the same
 * judgement that removed the toggle and the in-place new-branch tool here).
 * A worktree row is different in kind: hopping there registers that folder
 * and opens a fresh session, touching no checkout, so it stays legal here —
 * and it is the one action a linked-worktree session most needs, since
 * moving between worktrees is the point of having them. What also stays is
 * the two tools that never move a checkout: fetch, and update-current — the
 * update fast-forwards the session's OWN worktree, the fetch is
 * repository-wide metadata. Non-git directories and load failures render
 * nothing. The confirm dialogs and the error toast live here too.
 *
 * Checking the worktree toggle pops the cutout confirm dialog right away:
 * confirming it cuts a NEW branch (`<current>-wt`, suffixes past taken
 * names) out of the current checkout into a fresh isolated worktree — the
 * current branch itself is occupied by the main worktree, so git refuses a
 * second worktree on it. The dialog stands alone above the chip (the
 * branch menu stays closed); the chip still opens the menu, where picking
 * another branch keeps the plain create-or-reuse flow and re-picking the
 * current branch stages the same cutout confirm. Dismissing the dialog and
 * sending the message anyway means the user knowingly stays in the current
 * directory — no separate notice fires on send.
 *
 * In-place branch creation (the menu toolbar's plus, worktree mode off)
 * opens the create flyout right of the branch card: type the name, press
 * Create — the new branch is cut from the session directory's current
 * checkout and checked out there in one stroke, the worktree-less sibling
 * of the cutout flow. A failure toasts and leaves the flyout open.
 *
 * Remote branches join the picker under their own menu group: picking one
 * stages the remote-twin confirm — the switch creates the local tracking
 * branch in place (git's dwim), the worktree pick creates the twin inside
 * its fresh worktree. Both rides go through the existing /switch and
 * /worktree routes, which already resolve `<remote>/name` display names.
 *
 * Worktrees get their own 「工作树」 group, listing every worktree but the
 * one the session sits in: the row menu's 「跳到此工作树」 registers that
 * directory and opens a blank session in it (adoptWorktree; no git action,
 * no confirm), and its 「删除工作树」 rides the shared removal flow behind
 * a fact-spelling confirm (uncommitted count, ahead commits, sessions to
 * be archived — the branch itself survives; a directory holding a running
 * session withholds the verb). On the main checkout's BLANK session the
 * group doubles as
 * the only way to reach a branch held by a worktree — those have left the
 * local group (git refuses to check them out twice, so a local-group row
 * would be a dead end). A linked-worktree session keeps that group and
 * gains the main checkout row (see {@link buildLinkedWorktreeRows}); a
 * started MAIN-checkout session drops the group — its directory is fixed.
