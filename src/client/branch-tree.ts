 * function has zero coverage by construction. Prefix compression, "a
 * branch that is also a folder", and single-vs-several remote prefix
 * stripping are exactly the rules that break quietly and are read back by
 * the search set, the expand-all scope, and the keyboard walk.

 * `path` is worktree-row-only: the directory a pick hops the session into.
