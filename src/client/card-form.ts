/**
 * Form over the `git-worktree` settings namespace.
 *
 * `rootDir` is READ-ONLY: it names the historical central storage location
 * (kept for the worktrees already living there — new ones are created inside
 * their repository), so the field reports its effective value and whether
 * the user layer carries it, but stages no edit.
 *
 * `keepWorktrees` is staged: a settings write is a durable, revision-fenced
 * document mutation, so the control stages what the user types and commits
 * it only on save.
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose: the client bundle-purity rule forbids value
 * imports across plugins, so this package stages and fences its own form
 * (and its own snapshot store) rather than importing another plugin's model.
 *
 * @module git-worktree/client/card-form
