/**
 * BranchMenu: the branch picker popup anchored to the composer branch chip.
 * The base Menu primitive exposes neither a height cap nor a search field,
 * so with many branches its portal list fills the viewport — this popup
 * replaces it with an owner-styled card: Menu's card chrome (r20,
 * elevation-prominent hairline, --dsw-specific-menu, see .menuCard;
 * hosts without the token fall back to shadow-lv3) on a
 * portal-fixed posture, with owner requirements baked in:
 *
 *   1. the card is capped at min(420px, 60vh) and only the branch rows
 *      scroll (heading, search, and the toolbar stay pinned);
 *   2. a search field is pinned at the card's bottom edge — the row list
 *      scrolls above it — filtering rows by case-insensitive substring
 *      while KEEPING the matching branches' ancestor folders (IDEA-style
 *      prune) and highlighting the hit substring;
 *   3. the card opens entirely above the chip: the CSS `bottom` pins its
 *      bottom edge ~6px above the chip's top, so it grows upward and can
 *      never cover the composer, whatever the branch count.
 *
 * Layout (IDEA branch-panel posture at popup scale): a narrow tool strip
 * on the left (locate-current + expand/collapse-all + new-branch), then a
 * main column of heading / tree / search. The list renders in TWO
 * top-level collapsible groups — local branches first, then remote
 * branches (each a folder-header-style row with chevron + count): under a
 * SINGLE remote the remote rows drop their `<remote>/` prefix (the header
 * already says "remote"; a stripped display name can never collide with a
 * local row because the host hides remote branches that have a local
 * twin), with SEVERAL remotes the full names stay so `origin`/`upstream`
 * become the folder layer beneath the header. Picking a remote row hands
 * the owner the real `<remote>/name` (see pick) — 签出 dwims the tracking
 * twin in place, and the worktree verbs spell the twin-in-worktree ask.
 * Selection model: a single click SELECTS a row (blue); Enter or the row's
 * RIGHT-CLICK menu executes — 签出 and the worktree hop run DIRECTLY (no
 * confirmation step; the switch is keep-open, the hop moves the session),
 * while the consequential verbs keep their dialogs (delete's confirm, the
 * create/rename inputs). While a dialog is open, clicking another row
 * re-anchors it (the old one-click pick flow).
 *
 * Rows also speak right-click: a cursor-anchored context menu (the browser's
 * native one is suppressed over rows only). A branch row gets the six-verb
 * set — 签出 (through `pick`, executed DIRECTLY — no confirmation step),
 * 新建 and 新建并检出
 * (the create flyout with the row as the `from` start point, the latter
 * adding `checkout` so `git switch -c <name> <from>`), 重命名分支 and
 * 删除分支 (local rows; a rename flyout prefilled with the current name /
 * the safe-delete confirm), 复制分支 — with each verb degenerating where it
 * has no object (current branch: no 签出, no 删除; canCreate gates the
 * write trio; remote rows: no rename, no delete). A worktree row keeps its
 * two-item launcher (hop + copy path). The menu is a second surface, never
 * a second semantics — it IS the execution channel (the double-click it
 * replaced is gone), alongside Enter for the keyboard.
 *
 * The create and rename flyouts open IN PLACE of the row menu — at the
 * very point it stood (staged-from-menu posture; the cursor never leaves
 * the conversation), clamped into the viewport. Each holds its input —
 * validated as you type (git ref-name rules plus a duplicate check against
 * the rows; the rename pre-fills the current name and disables an
 * unchanged draft) — and the Cancel/confirm pair. Confirming fires in ONE
 * stroke (no second confirm step — typing into the flyout and pressing the
 * button IS the intent). While the action runs the flyout freezes (busy
 * disables input and buttons); a failure toasts and leaves the flyout open
 * for a corrected retry, a success closes the flyout but KEEPS THE MENU
 * OPEN (the row-menu keep-open rule: 原地动作 — checkout, create, rename,
 * delete — leave the picker up for more rows; only session-hopping actions
 * close it). A confirm flyout staged WITHOUT the row menu (worktree picks
 * from Enter or a re-click) anchors to the card's right edge as before.
 * The flyouts are separate portals (not clipped by the card's
 * overflow:hidden); their width is content-driven, capped in CSS, wrapping.
 *
 * Every row is actionable, by construction: the owner never sends a branch
 * this directory cannot act on (a linked-worktree session gets its own
 * branch plus the OTHER worktrees — never another branch, see the chip's
 * `rows`), so there is no dimmed/locked state, no verb withheld per-row for
 * that reason, and nothing for the search field's Enter commit to skip.
 *
 * Close semantics: outside pointerdown (card, flyouts, row menu, and chip
 * excluded) cancels the confirm and closes the menu; Escape unwinds tier
 * by tier — row menu, confirm, create flyout, rename flyout, search text,
 * selection, the menu; Enter in the search field commits the first enabled
 * visible row.
 *
 * Long names and many branches: a clipped label shows the full name on
 * hover via the native title (gated to actually-clipped rows only). The
 * list ALWAYS renders as a full-depth '/' prefix tree: folder-header rows
 * (chevron + count) toggle; under an expanded folder, child rows show only
 * their own segment (indentation carries the hierarchy — no repeated path,
 * no color distinction); linear chains compress into one row. TREE_MIN_ROWS
 * only sets the DEFAULT opening depth: past it, just the checked-out
 * branch's chain starts open (centering still lands it mid-viewport); at
 * or under it, every folder starts open — few branches have nothing to hide.
